# Eurorack-total-and-complete-Eagle-libraries
First start, use with caution. This is an attempt to finally collect and conserve all the proven devices for Eurorack pcb design. USE WITH CAUTION!

Please fork, and contribute. I will update as the lib is used more and more and footprints are confirmed.

Many, many thanks to all the people creating the prints.
